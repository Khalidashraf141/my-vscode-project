/*
1. üî¥Shallow Copy (Default Copy)
[A shallow copy simply copies the values of data members--including pointers--as they are]
[In shallow copy: Both t1.ptr and t2.ptr point to the same memory address]
[so if you change one: Then both objects see the change because they share the same memory]
‚ùåProblem:
-When one object is destroyed, the memory is deleted.Then the other object still tries to access the same delted memory-causing a crash (dangling pointer).

2.Deep Copy
-A deep copy makes a completely new copy of the data in memory
