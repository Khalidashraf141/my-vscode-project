/*
üß†Concept: Effect of Access Specifiers in Inheritance
    1.Private Inheritance
    -When a base class is privately inherited,
    ->public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class.
    ->So,the derived class's own member function can use them, but objects of the derived class cannot access them directly.

    In short:
        - ‚úÖAccessible inside derived class methods.
        - ‚ùåNot accessible through derived class objects.
